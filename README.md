# Specification for reusable AngularJS components

_**Attention**: This document is a **WIP**! Since we want to collect as many opinions as possible, feel free to fork and send a Pull Request, or leave a comment on the [kick-off disussion](https://gist.github.com/PascalPrecht/5411171). We hope that once this specification is called final, developers of angular components will do things the same way, which will allow the Angular Team to provide better tooling._

### Preface
This specification should help you as a developer, as well as a consumer of angular components, to find, use and develop reusable angular components for the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io). It covers to parts:

1. The **consumer** perspective
2. The **creator/forker** perspective

The consumer perspective covers all topics on finding and using angular components, whereas the creator or forker part gives an in-depth description of how to create, structure and publish an angular component, as well as which naming conventions to follow for the component itself and the resulting bower package.
